# Hexagrama
Hexagram is a turn-based strategic role-playing game with magical elements, where the player explores a world interconnected by graphs, fights enemies with a queue system, and evolves their character through a skill tree. All of this is done under a logic structured with classic data structures such as stacks, maps, and recursion.
